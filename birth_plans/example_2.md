## The basics
- When is your due date? 
- Where do you plan to deliver your baby? 
- Do you prefer to have a vaginal or cesarean delivery? 
- Who is your main support person? Will you have a doula? 


## Labor environment 
- What do you want to happen while you’re in labor? 
- Who do you want in the room?
- Would you like to be able to move around during labor or eat and drink?
- What features will be most helpful for you? Music? Lighting? A tub or pool? 
- Do you have preferred labor positions?  


## Medical interventions and pain management 
- Do you have a preference for how your provider intervenes or the type of medicine you receive while in labor? Common examples include:  
- Artificial rupture of membrane (amniotomy): When your provider breaks your water or amniotic sac
- Epidural: An injection in your back to relieve pain in the lower part of your body
- Episiotomy: A cut in the tissue between the vagina and anus
- Fetal monitoring: A way to continuously measure your baby’s heartbeat and your contractions
- IV: A catheter inserted into the vein for fast delivery of fluid, pain medication or other substances
- Pitocin (oxytocin): A medicine that helps start labor and contractions (also called induction or augmentation)
- Vacuum extraction: A process that uses a vacuum to help a baby get through the birth canal 


## Delivery and after birth 
- What would you like to happen during and after you deliver your baby?  Dr. Southern routinely performs delayed cord clamping for one minute and encourages early skin-to-skin contact.
- Do you want visitors and when?
- Do you want photos?
- Are you planning to breastfeed right away, use formula or both?
- Do you have preferences for what to do with the placenta?  If so, you may want to discuss this with your provider before delivery as there may be certain requirements for this.
